<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About


In 2019 I decided to attend computer science engineering school because I wanted to build up enough knowledge and skills with the desire to apply them to the medical field. Currently the end of my second year, I finally decided that I want to specialize in the AI / Data Science domain. I am willing to play my part to take medicine to the next level and improve people's life.

I chose to dedicate my summer holidays to learning this new subject to ensure I find a final-year internship to put the first step into this world. To select which online training courses to follow, I mostly rely on the "Beginner to Data Scientist in 25 months: Every Project and What I Learnt" blog, written by Chris Lovejoy in September 2020. He details his journey on how he went from medicine graduation to a full-time data scientist position in healthcare, including the courses he followed and his personal projects.

Therefore I decided to go with the following:

- [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction), offered by DeepLearning.AI and Standford University
- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), offered by DeepLearning.AI
- [Data Science in Stratified Healthcare and Precision Medicine](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datascimed), offered by the University of Edinburgh

I set myself a learning pace of 32 hours per week for an overall completion time of about two months.

This repository gathers all the notebooks I used to summarize all the course notions I encountered. To make things more interesting &ndash; and make sure I understand the concepts &ndash; I use different data than in the courses.
